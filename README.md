This project aims to provide a fast, secure and robust file-synchronization and -backup utility that can be used with a large variety of storage providers including cloud services like Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Storage but can also handle old-fashioned services like FTP(s), SCP, WebDAV or some mounted path.
