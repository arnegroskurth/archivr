- (Potential) bugs
    - Deadlock prevention
        - Ensure same locking order of vaults
        - Same lockAdapter across multiple vaults?
- Features
    - Use full available mtime/ctime resolution
    - Add "force-local" parameter to synchronization to be able to "keep" restored state
        - Automatically call after restore (can optionally be prevented)
    - More logging verbosity
        - Ask for confirmation on sync/restore commands
            - Mind --no-interaction option
        - (Injectable) EventManager (PSR-14)
    - Split large files in blob chunks
        - CSV UUIDs in index
        - Configuration per vault
    - Synchronization without archival
        - Delete old blobs on sync
    - Phar compilation
        - Installer ala getcomposer.org
    - WebDAV endpoint
    - GUI
        - WebApp?
    - Inotify watcher
- Encryption

- Performance
    - Detect file moving using hash/mtime to uniquely identify file content
        - Copy/Move locally to prevent download
        - Reuse blobId to prevent update
    - Selective compression
        - Most media files are already compressed
- Code quality
    - Renamed ConnectionConfiguration to VaultConnection
    - Versionable (across archivr versions) Local/Remote index format
